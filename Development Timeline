This timeline outlines the key phases for research, design, and development of the GreenWeaver AI by The Hemp Nation Group.


GreenWeaver AI: A Holistic Habitat Monitoring System
User-Centric Interfaces for GreenWeaver AI: Tailored Experiences for Diverse Users
Phase 1: Research & Planning (12 Weeks)
Week 1-4:
Conduct in-depth research on existing agricultural AI solutions, focusing on multi-source data integration, real-time processing, and user-centric interfaces.
Analyze relevant datasets for hemp farming, including soil conditions, weather patterns, crop yields, and market trends.
Define the core functionalities of GreenWeaver AI, including:
Crop and product mapping with satellite imagery and drone footage integration.
Yield optimization through rotational crop planning and recommendations.
Workflow and transport optimization for hemp and hemp combination products.
Real-time monitoring and inspection capabilities.
Week 5-8:
Design the architecture of GreenWeaver AI, considering data acquisition, processing, analysis, and user interface components.
Select appropriate AI algorithms and machine learning models for crop mapping, yield optimization, and workflow optimization.
